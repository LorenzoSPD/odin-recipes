    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>What to do when your 8-year old nephew comes to visit? Make pizza, of course!</p>
    <p>Well, not of course, actually. I didn't think of it until we exhausted Sorry, Monopoly, and gin rummy. 
        But it did turn out to be a brilliant idea as my father had just received a baking stone for Christmas, 
        and my nephew loves pizza.</p>
